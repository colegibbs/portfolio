Before transitioning to Software Development, I was pursuing a Chemistry degree, but I took a coding class as an elective and was hooked. I then transitioned to a rigorous programming boot camp at Code Fellows, which has prepared me to be a strong asset to your company. I’m a strategic and logical thinker, love solving problems and working through challenges, and I’m a great collaborator.  These traits help make me a great programmer and a valuable team member. I am committed, creative, project orientated and can’t wait to join a team and use my passion and skills to create cool product",
